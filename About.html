        Cotton (Kapas) is one of the most important soft fiber crops cultivated primarily in hot and dry climates. It is typically grown as a Kharif crop, sown during the monsoon season, usually between June and July. Cotton cultivation requires proper irrigation, timely pest control, and balanced use of fertilizers to ensure a healthy yield. The cotton plant not only provides the raw material for the textile industry but also produces cotton seeds, which are used for oil extraction, and cottonseed cake, which is widely used as animal fodder. GURU KRUPA KHOL & BEEJ BHANDAR is proud to support cotton farmers with quality seeds, fertilizers, and expert agricultural guidance. Gujarat, our home state, holds the distinction of being the largest cotton-producing state in India.

        Peanut (groundnut) is an important leguminous crop that is widely cultivated across the world, especially in warm and dry climates. It is typically grown during the Kharif season, which begins with the onset of the monsoon in June and July, and is harvested around September to October. Peanuts are highly nutritious, being a rich source of protein, healthy oils, vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber. They are used in various forms, such as snacks, peanut butter, and to extract peanut oil, which is popular in cooking. The cultivation of peanuts requires proper soil preparation, timely sowing, adequate irrigation, and effective pest and disease control to ensure good yields. High-quality seeds and appropriate fertilizers play a vital role in achieving healthy crops. Organizations like GURU KRUPA KHOL & BEEJ BHANDAR are dedicated to supporting peanut farmers by providing superior seeds, fertilizers, and expert advice, helping them increase productivity and ensure a successful harvest.

        GURU KRUPA KHOL & BEEJ BHANDAR provides high-quality Soyabean Beej (soybean seeds) for farmers looking to achieve better yields and healthier crops. Soyabean is a major Kharif crop in India, grown for its rich oil and protein content. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained black or loamy soil. Popular high-yielding varieties like JS-335, JS-9560, and MACS-1407 are available, maturing in 90 to 110 days. The recommended seed rate is 60 to 80 kg per acre, depending on whether the land is irrigated or rainfed. To ensure strong germination and plant health, seeds should be treated with fungicides and biofertilizers like Rhizobium and PSB. Though primarily a rainfed crop, 1–2 irrigations during flowering and pod formation can significantly boost yield. Proper fertilization with urea, SSP, and potash enhances productivity. Pests such as stem flies and girdle beetles should be managed with the right insecticides. With timely sowing (mid-June to early July) and good management practices, farmers can expect a yield of 14–16 quintals per acre. Harvesting is done when the pods dry and turn brown, ensuring high-quality grains. For trusted soybean seeds and expert farming guidance, farmers rely on GURU KRUPA KHOL & BEEJ BHANDAR.
